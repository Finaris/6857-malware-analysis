# Web Scraping

**!!! IMPORTANT !!!**  
Please read the following before beginning.

We will be scraping information from the URLs listed at: https://zeltser.com/malicious-ip-blocklists/

Below will be a list of URLs that we have written scrapers for, as well
as which ones remain and which are in progress. Please check in with the
group, or update the list below, before claiming a URL. 

Also, if there is a particular piece of malware which you encounter (which will be a lot),
then you should hash the malicious file associated with it (or get unique information about it).
This will allow us to detect duplicates. If you don't want to manually hash it, you can
try uploading it to: https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/upload
