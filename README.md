## Description
For our final project for 6.857, we will collect a large volume of data about
current malware in order to draw useful insights and meaningful predictions
about the future direction of such malware. In particular, we will accomplish
the following tasks:

* Perform a meta-analysis of existing malware trends (drawing upon completed
  studies and information).
* Collect our own data from blacklisted URLs. Useful information we hope to
  track includes but is not limited to: origin country, targeted platforms, 
  source languages, attack vectors, payloads, and type of vulnerability 
  exploited.
* Randomly sample malware and perform static and dynamic analysis to extract
  specific information.
* Create predictions using all this data on the future direction of malware.
* BONUS: Through static and dynamic analysis, it is possible we can find a
  reportable exploit. If so, we can alert the appropriate individuals.
  
Overall, we hope to aggregate all of this information to contribute to the
present space of malware analysis as well as identify new kinds of 
vulnerabilities.
